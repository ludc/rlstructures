class VecEnv:
    """
    An VecEnvironment corresponds to multiple 'gym' environments (i.e a batch)
    that are running simultaneously.

    At each timestep, upon the B environments, a subset B' of envs are running
    (since some envs may have stopped).

    So each observation returned by the VecEnv is a DictTensor of size B'. To
    mark which environments that are still running, the observation is returned
    with a mapping vector of size B'. e.g [0,2,5] means that the observation 0
    corresponds to the env 0, the observation 1 corresponds to env 2, and the
    observation 3 corresponds to env 5.

    Finally, when running a step (at time t) method (over B' running envs), the
    agent has to provide an action (DictTensor) of size B'. The VecEnv will return
    the next observation (time t+1) (size B'). But some of the B' envs may have
    stopped at t+1, such that actually only B'' envs are still running. The
    step method will thus also return a B'' observation (and corresponding
    mapping).

    The return of the step function is thus:
        ((DictTensor of size B', tensor of size B'),
        (Dicttensor of size B'', mapping vector if size B''))
