    Describes an agent responsible for producing actions when receiving
    observations and agent states.

    At each time step, and agent receives observations (DictTensor of size B),
    and agent states (DictTensor of size B) that reflect the agent's internal
    state.

    It then returns a triplet:
        agent state when receiving the observation (DictTensor): it is the
            agent state before computing anything. It is mainly used to
            initialize the state of the agent when facing initial states from the environment.
        action (DictTensor): the action + and additional outputs produced by
            the agent
        next agent state (DictTensor): the new state of the agent after all
            the computation. This value will then be provided to the agent at
            the next timestep.
